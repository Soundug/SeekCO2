# Introduction

I came across the theme of the hackathon which is **sustainability**. Immediately, I thought of ways that we are affecting the planet becoming the cause of global warming and climate change. Which is why I looked up on the internet for some efficient ways that could help us reduce our carbon footprints as an individual. Looking at the statistics of CO2 emissions of many countries, I realized that the smallest things bring the biggest changes in the nature.

# What It Does

It brings out the thought of estimating carbon footprints of an individual on a yearly basis. It is more like a self-reflection test that we perform within our mind further impacting the way we use natural resources that emit greenhouse gases. 
It is a static website.


## Getting Started

**Step 1. Clone the code into a fresh folder**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MLH/mlh-hackathon-nodejs-starter.git
$ cd mlh-hackathon-nodejs-starter
```

**Step 2. Install Dependencies.**

Next, we need to install the project dependencies, which are listed in `package.json`.

```
$ npm install
```

Now we're ready to start our server which is as simple as:

```
$ npm start
```

Open http://localhost:5000 to view it in your browser.

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and warnings in the console.
